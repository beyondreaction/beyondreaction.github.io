# Attending

### Who should attend
This workshop is intended for graduate students, academic researchers, designers, clinicians, industry practitioners, UX and product teams, policy-makers and community stakeholders who work at the intersection of AI, sensing, and health. We particularly welcome interdisciplinary teams and contributors working on personalization, explainability, ethics, evaluation, and socio-technical governance in and around proactive care.

### Capacity & registration
- While we are expecting a maximum capacity of 50, both accepted poster presentators and others are welcome to register for the workshop. Preference will be given to accepted poster presenters if interests exceeds capacity.
- All participants must be registered through the IH'26 conference registration — the workshop is an affiliated IH'26 event. Accepted poster authors must ensure at least one author attends in person to present.

### Online participation
- The workshop is hybrid; online participants (only available for those who are not presenting an accepted poster) will join via Zoom. Online participation will be moderated by organizers to enable synchronous discussion and Q&A. Accepted posters will have an online equivalent display on the website so remote attendees can engage with the poster presenters during the poster sessions.

### Before the workshop
- We will run a short pre-workshop survey to gather participants’ interests and prepare discussion topics. Propspective participants will be invited to submit suggested discussion questions and topics in advance.
