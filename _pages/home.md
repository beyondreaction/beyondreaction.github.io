# Healthcare Beyond Reaction: Harnessing AI and Sensing for Proactive Care @ IH '26

As AI and sensing technologies increasingly shape everyday health tools, they often miss the complex, lived realities of care — especially the integration of physical and mental health, personalization, privacy, and equity. The _Beyond Reaction_ workshop brings together researchers, designers, clinicians, industry practitioners, and policy makers to identify practical directions for AI and sensing systems that support proactive, inclusive, and ethically-grounded care.

### Goals

- Explore meaningful integration of physical and mental health in AI-driven systems.
- Identify ethical, technical, and deployment challenges (bias, personalization, engagement).
- Develop strategies and collaborations for inclusive, equitable, and sustainable AI-driven health solutions.

### Logistics (high level)

- Format: **One-day hybrid workshop** at [IH'26](https://ih.acm.org/) (in-person + Zoom for online participants).
